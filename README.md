# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

Pewlett Hackard is looking ahead to plan for a potentially large number of retirements and the offer of retirement packages. Human Resources implemented employee research to determine which employees will be retiring and how many positions will need to be filled. An employee database was designed utilizing SQL to manage the companyâ€™s current 300,024 employee records.  This analysis examined which employees are eligible for a retirement package and provide insight into managing a wave of upcoming retirements through a potential mentorship program.

## Results

### Anticipated Retirees By Title

Those expected to retire were determined by a query of employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955 and the title that these employees held in the company. Because employees may have had more than one title during their employ, the data was filtered to the last title the employee held. This information is provided in the table.

The query was then modified to narrow it down by including only those with a hire date between January 1, 1985 and December 31, 1988. This information is provided in the table below.
